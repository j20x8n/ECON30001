Question 1. When   considering   a   possible   Raphael   painting, the   National   Gallery   lists ﬁve   possible attributions that could be made:
• By Raphael (B): almost   certainly   painted   by   the   master   himself.
• Attributed to Raphael (A): possibly   painted   by   the   master, some   doubt.
• by the Studio of Raphael (S):   painted   by   a   pupil,   probably   under   the   master’s   di-rection.
• a Follower of Raphael (F): painted   by   someone   at   the   time, inﬂuenced   by   Raphael.
• an Imitator of Raphael (I): painted   by   someone   highly   inﬂuenced   by   Raphael, per-   haps at   a much   later   date.
John   is   an   art   collector,   looking to   ﬁnd   Raphael paintings.    He   can place   an   Imitator, but   cannot distinguish between other attributions.Peter   and   Robert   have   some   expertise   in   art   identiﬁcation.    Peter   can   place   any   painting   into   either   “By   or   Attributed   or   Studio” or   “Follower   or   Imitator”   .    Robert   can   place   any painting   into   either “By   or   Attributed”, “Studio   or   Follower”,   or   “Imitator”   .(a) Write   down   each   person’s   information   structure.   Sketch   them   in   a   state-space   diagram.
(b) Does   Robert   have   better   information   than   John?
(c) Does   Peter   have   better   information   than   John?
(d) Does   asymmetric   information   exist   between   Peter   and   Robert?
(e) Suppose   that   John   really   wants   a “By   Raphael”   .   Since   Peter   cannot   accurately   identify this   attribution, is   it   worth   listening   to   him   at   all?Question 2. There   is   a   virus, disease Y, that   is   a   serious   concern   for   human   health.   Fortu-   nately,   a   very   accurate   test   for   disease Y has   been   developed.    The   test   is   99.9%   accurate.   Someone   with   disease Y is   correctly   diagnosed   with   probability   0.999,   and   someone   not infected   is   correct代 写ECON30001 Problem Set 1SQL
代做程序编程语言ly   diagnosed   with   probability   0.999.    It   has   been   estimated   that   50,000   people   in   the   population   of   100 million   are   infected.
Suppose   that   Bob   is   selected   at   random   and   tested.    He   receives   the   diagnosis   that   he   is   infected.   What is the probability that Bob is infected?
Question 3. Consider   two   expected   utility   representations U = Eu and V = Ev .    Prove   that U and V are ordinally equivalent if u and v are cardinally equivalent.Question 4. In   the   lecture,   we   used   the   axioms   of mixture monotonicity, reduction, sub- stitution,   and continuity.      There   are   many   other   axiomatisations   in the   literature.    A   well-   known axiom is the following:(The Sure Thing Principle) For all lotteries p1,… , pJ, q1,…, qK, r and s we have: 

where α1, …, αJand β1,… , βK are such that the compound lotteries above are well-defined.
(a) Represent   the   lotteries   above   diagrammatically   and   explain   the   intuition   of the   sure-   thing principle.
(b) Substitute   the   expected   utility   functional   form   to   show   that   the   sure-thing   principle   is   a   necessary   condition   for   expected   utility   maximisation.
Question 5. Consider the following choices:

and, 
This   pair   of   choices   was ﬁrst   proposed   by   Nobel   Laureate   Maurice   Allais   in   the   early   1950s,   shortly after the publication of von Neumann and Morgenstern’s work.   Allais’ prediction,   later   conﬁrmed   by   a   large   body   of work   in   experimental   economics,   was   that   the   modal   pattern of   preferences would be:2A ≻ B and A' ≺ B'   . 
(a) Show,   by   substituting   the   expected   utility   functional   form,   that   the   modal   pattern   of   preferences are incompatible with expected utility maximisation.
(b) Show that it is the sure thing principle in particular   that   is   violated   in   Allais’   example   (see   Question   4).
